## Usage

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Watch SCSS Folder

```bash
npm run sass (node-sass)
```

The compiled files will be put into the dist/css folder - you only need to edit the scss folder files.

### Contact Page Form Submission

We used `Netlify` Hosting Services to deploy the project.

To make the contact form work, adapt the contact form attributes to your hosting service.

### Optimization

Images used in the gallery section can be optimized for better performance.
