This is a portfolio website built using `HTML`, `CSS` and `SASS` compiler from the [**Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning**](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW) Traversy Media Course
(link to the revamp version on Udemy).

## Usage

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Watch SCSS Folder

```bash
npm run sass (node-sass)
```

The compiled files will be put into the dist/css folder - you only need to edit the scss folder files.

### Contact Page Form Submission

We used `Netlify` Hosting Services to deploy the project.

To make the contact form work, adapt the contact form attributes to your hosting service.
